Description: process genome alignment in the Multiple Alignment Format (example data)
 MafFilter applies a series of "filters" to a MAF file, in order to
 clean it, extract data and computer statistics while keeping track of
 the associated meta-data such as genome coordinates and quality scores.
 .
  * It can process the alignment to remove low-quality / ambiguous /
    masked regions.
  * It can export data into a single or multiple alignment file in
    format such as Fasta or Clustal.
  * It can read annotation data in GFF or GTF format, and extract the
    corresponding alignment.
  * It can perform sliding windows calculations.
  * It can reconstruct phylogeny/genealogy along the genome alignment.
  * It can compute population genetics statistics, such as site
    frequency spectrum, number of fixed/polymorphic sites, etc.
 .
 This package provides example data for maffilter.

Description: Multi-OpenRobot Simulation Engine
 List of morse features:
  * Versatile simulator for generic mobile robots simulation
    (single or multi robots),
  * Realistic and dynamic environments (interaction with other agents like
    humans or objects),
  * Based on well known and widely adopted open source projects (Blender for 3D
    rendering + UI, Bullet for physics simulation, dedicated robotic
    middlewares for communications + robot hardware support),
  * Seamless workflow: since the simulator rely on Blender for both modeling
    and the real time 3D engine, creating and modifying a simulated scene is
    straightforward.
  * Entirely scriptable in Python,
  * Adaptable to various level of simulation realism (for instance the
    simulation of exteroceptive sensors like cameras or a direct access to
    higher level representations of the world, like labeled artifacts),
  * Currently compatible with ROS, YARP and the LAAS OpenRobots robotics
    frameworks,
  * Easy to integrate to other environments via a simple socket interface,
  * Fully open source, BSD license.
 .

Description: General SoundFont from MuseScore (HQ version, lossy)
 This is the HQ version for the new standard hard disc space-saving
 SF3 format soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2 and newer.
 .
 This release of the soundfont supports Single-Note Dynamics with
 MuseScore 3.2 and higher.
 .
 MuseScore_General_HQ aims at providing the best audio quality and
 soundfont programming features, while being a compatible drop-in
 replacement for the less heavyweight MuseScore_General soundfont,
 providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set, with separate
 ensemble samples for several instruments, and some extras.
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format, although early implementations (such as the one
 from MuseScore before release 2.2) had bugs making the resulting
 sound bad; instead use fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont for those.
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont. It is sufficient
 to reproduce the licence and copyright notice in any “associated
 documentation files” provided with your generated waveforms.
 .
 The musescore-general-soundfont-small package contains the normal
 soundfont (as shipped with MuseScore 3.x), lossily SF3 compressed.
 The musescore-general-soundfont package similarly provides the
 HQ version of the soundfont (with separate ensembles instruments
 and other large improvements) as SF3, whereas the SF2 HQ version
 is packaged as musescore-general-soundfont-lossless for use with
 synthesisers lacking SF3 support, by audiophiles, and to avoid
 long MuseScore startup times; however with a large disc footprint.
 .
 This package will be installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ which
 is the standard Debian location for system-wide SF3 soundfonts.

Description: OPL3 SoundFont that simulates the sound of an OPL3 chip
 This package provides a soundfont (sf2) that can be used by FluidSynth,
 Timidity and WildMidi to play MIDI (and MIDI-like files) using the samples
 created by the OPL3 (SB16/YM262) chip. This also allows applications like
 DOSBox, ZDoom and others to play back MIDI without having to emulate the
 OPL3, which can be costly in terms of CPU usage to emulate accurately.
 .
 This package will be installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf2/.
